# WEATHER-API-App
’m excited to share that I’ve successfully built a Weather API Web Application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! 🌐  This app fetches real-time weather data using the WeatherAPI and displays current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air quality based on user input.
